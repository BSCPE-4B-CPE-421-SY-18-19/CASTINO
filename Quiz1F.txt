CPE 421 (TROUBLE SHOOTING O COMPUTER SYSTEM)




OBSERVATION
	- the led on the motherboard lights up.
	- the fans that attached on the system works well.
	- the monitor wont turn on.
	- the computer only turns on for only a few seconds.
	- we conclude that the power supply cannot support the entire system to turn on.


POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
	- the fuse of the powersupply needed to be replaced.
	- the capacitor also needed to be replaced because the capacitor on the
	  powersupply bloated.
	- we conclude that the powersupply needed to be replaced.
